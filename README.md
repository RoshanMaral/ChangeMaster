# CoinSolver â€“ Coin Change Solver Web Application

## Description
**CoinSolver** is an interactive web-based tool that calculates coin change using two approaches:  
- **Greedy Algorithm:** Picks the largest coin first for quick results (may not be optimal).  
- **Dynamic Programming (DP):** Computes the optimal solution with the minimum number of coins.  

Compare heuristic vs optimal strategies by entering any amount. Built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, it runs in any modern browser.

---

## Features
- Interactive user input for the amount.  
- Displays results for **Greedy** and **DP** algorithms.  
- Shows coins used and total count for each method.  
- Lightweight, easy to use, and educational.

## Technologies Used
- HTML  
- CSS  
- JavaScript

## How to Use
1. Clone or download this repository.  
2. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser.  
3. Enter the amount you want to make change for.  
4. Click **Solve** to view results for both algorithms.

## Example
**Available Coins:** [1, 2, 5, 10]  
**Amount:** 18  

**Output:**  
- Greedy Algorithm: 10, 5, 2, 1 (4 coins)  
- DP Optimal Solution: 10, 5, 2, 1 (4 coins)

## Future Enhancements
- Allow custom coin denominations.  
- Visualize algorithm step-by-step.  
- Compare performance on large datasets.
